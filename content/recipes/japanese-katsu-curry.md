An easy Japanese Curry dish that can be vegetarian or packed with protein.

1. Large onions (2)
2. Medium carrots (2)
3. Red Potatoes (3)
4. Garlic (2 cloves)
5. Ginger (1 inch cube, peeled)
6. Water or stock (5 cups)
	- Alternatively 5 cups of water to 1-2 stock cubes (chicken or beef)
7. Japanese curry roux (1 box, or roughly 8 oz/220g) 
	- S&B Golden Curry, Vermont Curry, Java Curry, Torokeru Curry, Kokumaro Curry works great.

	- Pink Lady or Jazz Apples can work as alternatives.
12. **Optional**: Beef or any meat you would like (400g~)
	- If going for beef, chuck is great for stews.
